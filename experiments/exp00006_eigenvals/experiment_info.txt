This is the initial setup of our eigenval experiments.  Here we obtain the eigenvals/vecs of the loss hessian at each iteration and compute and inner product with the weight update. We find the eigenvec which aligns most closely with the weight update and save off the corresponding eigenvalue.  the hypothesis is that inner product size will be positively correlated with eigenval size on the fine level and negatively correlated on the coarse level. •	Obtain set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues from hessian•	Need to subtract weight update after – before.•	Need to look at this for x1, x2_bar, x3 and the various levels.  May also need to do a cross check i.e. I need to look at the update on x2_bar with respect to the original network.•	Need to plot this all over the iterations somehow•	Need to compute a correlation factor between the inner product size and the eigenvalue size.  If this works out we should see positive correlation on the fine level and  negative correlation on the coarse level.  Large inner products should correspond to small eigenvalues•	I think the loop should work like this:o	Given weight update, take inner product with every eigenvector. Save off index or something with the largest inner product. You will also need to save off something with relative size information of the eigenvalues.o	Do this for every iteration and then plot at the end.
